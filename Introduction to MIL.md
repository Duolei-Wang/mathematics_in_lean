# MIL tutorial

Author: Mulikas Lin (Nickname)

This is a new repository as the fork of mathematics in Lean. After graduation, I spent most of my time on other things, which made my skills in Lean weak. So, I deleted the older one and forked it again.

This time, I will fill in the answer as well as write some notes for it. I don't want to stop at some places and say it's enough to be here.

I'll catch my goals; see you later in 25 Fall.

# Ch1. Fundamentals

## 1. The Philosophy of Construction as Proof

Mathematics is composited with **logic** and **mathematical structure**. To **prove** something is to build a new object with existing ones. Indeed, when you do more exercise, you'll find the logic equations can be also considered as some structures.

### Neccessary Logic background

#### Universial Quantifier ($\forall$)





## 2. Actions the target

**rewrite/rw**

**refine**




## 3. Actions on the structure
